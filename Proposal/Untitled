I plan to make a real time GPA estimator/ calculator for my classes.

I plan to include assignments, quizzes, and tests, along with a way to add the grades received on assignments tests and quizzes throughout the course. This feature will project your final grade based on the average grade on previous tests and assignments. Projected grade will be converted to a 4.0 scale and adjusted based on credit hours of the class. 4.0 scale will be calibrated to hours and project a GPA.

need to do:
- input class name
- define percentage worth assignment, test, quizzes
- define hours of class
- add and average gpa by hours


FOR EACH CLASS:
  ability to name class
  say what things are graded and weight of grade
  ask how many quizzes or tests or etc there are, make an array
  input grades for each quiz and average based on array length
  predict a percentage
  convert to ABCDF scale based on % and display class grade. save gpa number and hours worth


GENERAL:
  continue asking for classes until "have any more classes you want to add" == no
  calculate gpa by hours in class total
  cout what gpa is and grade for each class, along with quiz and test average.


PSEUDOCODE FOR CLASS:
  ask name for class
  ask for hours of class
  select if there are tests and/or assignments and/or quizzes
  make variables named these things
  ask for percent weight to each of these variables. function for each and variable for percentage
  ask for percentage received for each quiz/test/assignment for all quizzes and append to array
  average by length of array
  define to variable score of quiz
  multiply avg score of quiz by percent weight
  add avgs*weight to get class percentage
  convert to ABCDF for cout
  convert ABCDF to 4.0 scale
  multiply by hours in class
  define variable class to gpa * hour function

PSEUDOCODE FOR GENERAL:
  add all classes * hour to get overall gpa
  cout each class and avg determined for each subject
  cout gpa
